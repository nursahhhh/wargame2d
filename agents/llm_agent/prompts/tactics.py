### TACTICAL PRINCIPLES & CONSIDERATIONS FOR 2D COMBAT GRID GAME
**Purpose:** This guide presents core tactical concepts and strategic patterns observed in 2D combat grid scenarios. It is NOT a prescriptive rulebook—treat it as a menu of ideas to inform your own tactical decisions based on specific battlefield conditions.


### VICTORY CONDITION
Destroy enemy AWACS while protecting yours. Time costs resources - aggressive progress required.

### CORE PRINCIPLES

#### 1. AWACS PROTECTION (TOP PRIORITY)
- Keep AWACS at maximum rear distance with clear escape routes
- Maintain 2+ unblocked retreat paths at all times
- Position multiple defensive layers between AWACS and threats
- AWACS is valuable but, as long as it is in the safe distance, it can be used for radar spotting to support offensive actions.

#### 2. INFORMATION WARFARE
- Radar detection is SHARED across team (if one unit sees an enemy, all units can target it)
- Use decoys to probe unknown areas and reveal enemy SAM positions
- Avoid clustering units (limits tactical flexibility and creates single points of failure)

#### 3. TARGET PRIORITY
1. Enemy AWACS (if accessible - game-winning)
2. Enemy aircraft threatening your AWACS
3. Enemy SAMs blocking your advance path
4. Enemy decoys (LOWEST - avoid wasting ammunition)

#### 4. DISTANCE CONTROL & AMMUNITION ECONOMY
- **Control engagement distance:** Stay outside enemy weapon range when not attacking; close distance to engage
- Fire at closer range for higher hit probability (distance determines hit chance)
- Coordinate multi-unit strikes on tough targets (avoid overkill)
- Don't waste missiles on suspected decoys
- Each shot counts - make them matter

#### 5. SAM TACTICS
- **Stealth Positioning:** Keep SAMs OFF until optimal moment and bait enemy into range.
- **Ambush Pattern:** Toggle ON → Shoot → Toggle OFF immediately
- **Cooldown Safety:** Stay stealthed during ~5-turn reload period
- **Surprise > Sustained Fire:** One good ambush shot beats continuous exposure

#### 6. DECOY OPERATIONS
- Mix decoys with real aircraft to create targeting uncertainty
- Use decoys to bait enemy fire away from valuable units
- Send decoys ahead to absorb fire and clear paths
- Still don't lose decoy for nothing, try to trade decoy for an enemy entity if possible
- Enemy can't distinguish decoys - exploit this

#### 7. FORMATION CONCEPTS
**Defense:** Layered screen with aircraft forward, AWACS back, hidden SAMs for surprise, bait enemy into kill zones.
**Offense:** Decoy(s) in front, aircraft follow 2-3 cells back to exploit cleared paths, AWACS behind for radar support.

#### 8. TEMPO & AGGRESSION
- Static defense loses to operational costs over time, but it is a balance
- Apply pressure to force enemy into reactive positions
- Trading 1 aircraft for enemy AWACS = victory
- Once enemy weakened, commit to AWACS strike

#### 9. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
- Overlapping radar coverage (shared detection makes this wasteful)
- Shooting at maximum range (low hit % wastes precious ammo)
- Single escape route for AWACS (death trap)
- Keeping SAMs constantly ON (makes them easy targets)
- Engaging obvious decoys (ammo waste)
- All units in one corridor (easily blocked/countered)

#### 10. WINNING PATTERNS
- **SAM Ambush:** Hide SAM → Bait enemy into range → Toggle ON + Shoot → Toggle OFF
- **Decoy Screen:** Decoys lead, aircraft follow 2-3 cells back, exploit cleared path
- **Pincer Movement:** Attack from multiple directions to trap enemy AWACS
- **Breakthrough Timing:** Thin enemy defenses first, then commit to AWACS kill

### DECISION FRAMEWORK EACH TURN
1. Is my AWACS safe? (If no - prioritize defense immediately)
2. Can I damage/kill enemy AWACS? (If yes - consider aggressive strike)
3. What new enemy positions revealed? (Update threat assessment)
4. Which units can contribute to objective? (Advance those, position others)
5. Are SAMs optimally positioned for ambush? (Toggle timing critical)
6. Is ammunition being used efficiently? (High-value targets only)

### REMEMBER
- Every turn costs resources - make progress toward enemy AWACS
- Control distance: stay safe when repositioning, close in when engaging
- Decoys are disposable intelligence assets - use them
- SAMs are ambush weapons, not frontline fighters
- Protect AWACS > Everything else"""
