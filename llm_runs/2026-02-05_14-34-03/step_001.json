I must follow the strict priority order.\n\n\n## Assessing Mission Objectives\n- The primary goals are to destroy the enemy AWACS, protect friendly AWACS, and gain information dominance.\n- The mission requires following a strict priority order to achieve these objectives.\n\n## Evaluating Friendly Units\n- Friendly AWACS#1 is located at [4, 0], is mobile, and unarmed.\n- It has radar capabilities, which may be crucial for maintaining information dominance.\n\n## Assessing Friendly Units  \n- AIRCRAFT#2 is at [9, 3], mobile, armed, with radar range 5, and currently faces no threats.  \n- AIRCRAFT#3 is at [9, 9], mobile, armed, with radar range 5, and also faces no threats.  \n- SAM#4 is at [3, 6], immobile, armed, with radar range 8, and currently has no threats.  \n\n## Evaluating Threat Levels  \n- No nearby enemies or threats detected, and no recent enemy activity noted.  \n- The global aggression estimate is 0.6, suggesting a higher tolerance for offensive actions due to lower immediate danger.  \n\n## Planning Next Steps  \n- Priority is AWACS survival, followed by destroying enemy AWACS (if detected), then radar avoidance and team-wide information gain.  \n- Exploration is critical, but no TEAM-UNSEEN high-priority scouting cells are provided, limiting immediate scouting options.\n\n## Understanding Action Framework\n- The response must use the \"select_actions\" function, with each action including an entity_id, action, direction (if moving), and reason_tag.\n- Entity IDs are integers (e.g., 1 for AWACS#1, 2 for AIRCRAFT#2), with actions like Move, Wait, or Shoot, and reason_tags like SCOUTING_BEHAVIOR or HOLD_POSITION.\n\n## Analyzing Movement Options\n- AWACS can Move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) or Wait; given no threats, doctrine suggests waiting to maintain stealth if no better position is clear.\n- Aircraft and SAM units should focus on exploration, moving to areas outside friendly radar coverage, but directions depend on assumed grid size and current positions.\n\n## Planning Unit Actions\n- With no TEAM-UNSEEN cells provided, assume initial state where most areas are unknown, prioritizing scouting for aircraft.\n- SAM likely defaults to Wait or Toggle (ON) since no targets are present, focusing on maintaining position without threats.\n\n## Choosing Unit Actions  \n- Each unit requires one action, with options like Move, Wait, Shoot, or Toggle, depending on the entity.  \n- The mission prioritizes exploration for information dominance, especially with no immediate threats detected.  \n\n## Deciding Movement Directions  \n- Aircraft should move to scout areas outside current friendly radar coverage, assuming edges are likely unseen.  \n- AIRCRAFT#2 at [9,3] could move LEFT to [8,3], and AIRCRAFT#3 at [9,9] could move LEFT to [8,9] for better coverage.  \n\n## Evaluating AWACS Strategy  \n- AWACS at [4,0] with radar range 9 may benefit from moving UP to [4,1] to increase coverage, given no known enemy positions.  \n- Doctrine suggests waiting if no clear advantage, so AWACS might Wait to maintain stealth in low-threat conditions.  \n\n## Considering SAM Actions  \n- SAM at [3,6] with radar range 8 and no targets likely defaults to Wait, as Shoot requires an enemy and Toggle is unnecessary without prior action.  \n- Reason_tag HOLD_POSITION fits for SAM to maintain position without threats.  \n\n## Assessing Exploration Context  \n- With no grid size provided, assume a standard layout (e.g., 10x10 or larger) where edges are unexplored.  \n- Global aggression at 0.6 suggests a medium-high tolerance for scouting, aligning with LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE or SCOUTING_BEHAVIOR.\n\n## Determining Radar Coverage  \n- AWACS at [4,0] with range 9 covers cells within Manhattan distance 9, including [9,3] (distance 8) but not [9,9] (distance 14).  \n- SAM at [3,6] with range 8 covers cells within Manhattan distance 8; [9,9] is outside this range (distance 9).  \n\n## Assessing Movement Constraints  \n- Aircraft cannot move to cells covered by friendly AWACS or SAM radar, as exploration inside these areas is forbidden.  \n- Current positions like [9,3] are covered by AWACS, so adjacent moves (e.g., [9,4], [9,2]) must be checked to ensure they are outside radar ranges.  \n\n## Identifying Exploration Opportunities  \n- Moves are illegal if the destination is TEAM-SEEN (observed at any time) or covered by AWACS/SAM radar, limiting aircraft to cells outside these ranges.  \n- From [9,3], adjacent cells are all within AWACS range, suggesting no immediate reachable TEAM-UNSEEN cells for exploration.  \n\n## Evaluating Grid Assumptions  \n- With no grid size provided, assume a large or infinite grid, but doctrine advises avoiding edges and corners for scouting.  \n- Reachable cells for movement likely mean adjacent cells, as moves are one step, impacting scouting strategy.",
