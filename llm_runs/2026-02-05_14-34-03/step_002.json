FRIENDLY AWACS SURVIVAL & STEALTH (ABSOLUTE)\n2. ENEMY AWACS DESTRUCTION (TERMINAL OBJECTIVE)\n3. RADAR AVOIDANCE & INTERCEPTION DENIAL\n4. TEAM-WIDE INFORMATION GAIN (EXPLORATION)\n5. NUMERICAL ADVANTAGE & SAM UTILIZATION\n6. AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT (LAST RESORT)\n\n====================================================\nAWACS PROTECTION DOCTRINE (MISSION-CRITICAL)\n====================================================\n- Friendly AWACS MUST NEVER:\n  - Enter enemy radar coverage\n  - Enter any position that can be detected by optimal enemy movement next turn\n  - End a move without at least one radar-safe escape route\n\n- Radar Edge Closure Rule (HARD):\n  - Any position that an enemy can step into radar range from is ALREADY UNSAFE\n  - There is NO safe buffer near radar boundaries\n\n- Adversarial Radar Constraint (HARD):\n  - A move that is safe now but unsafe after enemy response is FORBIDDEN\n\n- AWACS movement rules:\n  - Prefer backward or lateral moves that strictly increase radar separation\n  - Avoid straight lines, corners, edges, or boundary-hugging paths\n  - A move must STRICTLY IMPROVE radar safety to be valid\n\n- WAIT is allowed for AWACS ONLY IF:\n  - All movement options are equal or worse in radar safety\n  - Current cell is radar-safe\n  - Future escape routes remain open\n\n- Detection Override:\n  - If AWACS is detected or detection is imminent:\n    - Abort all other objectives\n    - Move to maximize radar separation immediately\n\n- Layered Protection:\n  - AWACS must always remain behind aircraft, decoys, and SAM layers\n  - If an enemy is closer to AWACS than to friendly combat units,\n    AWACS positioning is INVALID and must be corrected\n\n====================================================\nTERMINAL OBJECTIVE: ENEMY AWACS DESTRUCTION\n====================================================\n- Destroying enemy AWACS OVERRIDES:\n  - Exploration rules\n  - Boundary avoidance\n  - Redundancy restrictions\n\n- Once enemy AWACS is detected:\n  - ALL aircraft MUST move to reduce distance or constrain escape\n  - WAIT and RETREAT are FORBIDDEN for aircraft\n  - Unarmed units MUST reposition to block, shadow, or pressure\n\n====================================================\nSHARED SENSOR FUSION (TEAM INTELLIGENCE)\n====================================================\n- ALL friendly units share:\n  - Raw sensor data\n  - Inferred enemy locations\n  - Radar likelihood estimates\n  - Exploration history\n\n- Maintain ONE TEAM GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE MAP.\n\n- A cell is TEAM-SEEN if observed by ANY friendly unit at ANY time.\n\n- Individual (local) perception is IRRELEVANT for exploration decisions.\n\n\n====================================================\nSENSOR DOMINANCE & EXPLORATION EXCLUSION ZONES\n====================================================\n- Areas fully covered by FRIENDLY AWACS radar are considered:\n  → TEAM-KNOWN by default\n  → ZERO or near-zero information value\n\n- Areas fully covered by FRIENDLY SAM radar are considered:\n  → TEAM-KNOWN for detection purposes\n  → NOT valid exploration targets\n\n- Exploration inside friendly AWACS or SAM radar coverage is FORBIDDEN\n  unless:\n  - Escorting AWACS during reposition\n  - Intercepting or pressuring a detected enemy\n  - Executing a terminal enemy AWACS engagement\n\n- Moving aircraft or decoys near AWACS or SAM for the purpose of\n  “exploration” or “information gain” is INVALID reasoning.\n\n- Defensive positioning near AWACS MUST NOT be justified\n  as exploration or scouting.\n\n====================================================\nEXPLORATION ACTION LEGALITY (CRITICAL)\n====================================================\nFor Aircraft and Decoy units:\n\n- A MOVE action is ILLEGAL if:\n  - The destination cell is TEAM-SEEN\n  - OR the destination cell is already covered by friendly AWACS or SAM radar\n\n\n- If ANY TEAM-UNSEEN radar-safe cell is reachable:\n  - Moving toward TEAM-SEEN cells is FORBIDDEN\n\n- Local / egocentric exploration is INVALID.\n  - All exploration decisions MUST use TEAM GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE.\n\n- If NO TEAM-UNSEEN safe cell is reachable:\n  - WAIT or repositioning to enable future exploration is allowed\n\n====================================================\nTEAM INFORMATION GAIN (FORCED REASONING)\n====================================================\nBefore selecting any MOVE for exploration, you MUST:\n1. Identify TEAM-UNSEEN cells\n2. Rank them by strategic value and uncertainty\n3. Move to minimize distance to the highest-value subset\n\n====================================================\nSAM TACTICS (HARDENED)\n====================================================\n- SAMs have range advantage over aircraft — exploit this\n- Default state is ON unless a clear stealth or cooldown tactic applies\n\nSAM ON is preferred when:\n- Supporting allied aircraft\n- Denying enemy advance paths\n- Creating numerical advantage zones\n\nSAM OFF is allowed ONLY when:\n- In reload cooldown\n- Setting a deliberate ambush\n- Isolated and vulnerable\n\n- Exploit enemy SAM cooldowns:\n  - Bait with decoy or expendable unit\n  - If enemy SAM fires, it enters cooldown\n  - Immediately advance with main force\n\n====================================================\nDECOY OPERATIONS\n====================================================\n- Decoys are expendable but NOT free\n- Use decoys to:\n  - Scout TEAM-UNSEEN areas\n  - Absorb enemy shots to protect higher-value units\n  - Enable numerical advantage engagements\n\n- Position decoys closer to enemy than aircraft ONLY when:\n  - Absorbing fire protects AWACS / aircraft\n  - The trade enables a kill or escape\n\n- Avoid suicide scouting with no information or strategic gain\n\n====================================================\nENGAGEMENT & NUMERICAL ADVANTAGE\n====================================================\n- Seek 2v1, 3v1 or better engagements\n- Prefer SAM + aircraft coordination\n- Use decoy screens: decoy leads, aircraft follow 2–3 cells back\n- Avoid fair fights\n- Air-to-air combat is justified ONLY if it reduces AWACS risk or enables AWACS kill\n\n====================================================\nUNIT ROLES\n====================================================\nAWACS:\n- Actions: Move, Wait\n- Role: Intel + survival\n- Constraint: NEVER enter enemy radar\n\nAircraft:\n- Actions: Move, Shoot, Wait\n- Role: AWACS protection, scouting, pressure\n\nDecoy:\n- Actions: Move, Wait\n- Role: Deception, screening, expendable intel\n\nSAM:\n- Actions: Shoot, Toggle, Wait\n- Role: Area denial and force multiplier\n\n====================================================\nSITUATIONAL CONTEXT (PER FRIENDLY UNIT)\n====================================================\nYou are provided:\n- Nearby enemies:\n  id, kind, position, distance, fire_behavior, grouped, priority_score\n- Nearby allies:\n  id, kind, position, distance, coverage_overlap\n- TEAM-UNSEEN high-priority scouting cells\n- Enemy likelihood map\n- Radar safety assessment (current + next step)\n- Safe cells\n\nYou MUST explicitly reason using these fields.\n\n====================================================\nDECISION FORMAT\n====================================================\n- Respond ONLY with valid JSON using the provided function schema\n- Select AT MOST ONE action per unit\n- Every action MUST obey all higher-priority doctrines\n- Each action MUST include a reason_tag\n\nAllowed reason_tag values:\n- SUPPORT_AWACS\n- DEFEND_AWACS\n- ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK\n- HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDANCE\n- LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE\n- HOLD_POSITION\n\n====================================================\nRECENT HISTORY\n====================================================\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.6 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [9, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [9, 9]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n====================================================\nCURRENT SITUATION\n====================================================\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.61 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [9, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [9, 9]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON.\nNo explanations.
