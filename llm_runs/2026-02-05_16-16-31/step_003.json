No enemy units are mentioned, so no enemy AWACS detected.\n\n\n## Reviewing game state  \n- Friendly units are moving leftward, including AWACS at [4,0], Aircraft#2 at [7,3], and Aircraft#3 at [7,9].  \n- SAM#4 is positioned at [3,6], and no enemy units, including AWACS, are detected in the current game state.\n\n## Reviewing game state  \n- The game emphasizes exploration, suggesting TEAM-UNSEEN cells likely exist, with no nearby threats detected.  \n- Mission priority P4 (gain information) is active since no enemy AWACS are detected and exploration is ongoing.  \n\n## Checking unit roles  \n- AWACS at [4,0] should stay put or move laterally/backward to avoid risk, given its priority to protect.  \n- At least one unit must advance exploration each turn when P4 is active to uncover TEAM-UNSEEN cells.  \n\n## Analyzing unit movements  \n- Aircraft#2 and #3 have moved leftward (e.g., #2 from [9,3] to [7,3], #3 from [9,9] to [7,9]), following a pattern.  \n- The grid is likely 10x10 or larger, inferred from current positions, though dimensions aren't specified.\n\n## Analyzing exploration needs  \n- Mission priority P4 (gain information) is active, requiring at least one unit to advance exploration each turn.  \n- Without a map, assume TEAM-UNSEEN cells exist outside current radar coverage, likely beyond current positions.  \n\n## Considering movement patterns  \n- Aircraft#2 and #3 have consistently moved left (decreasing X), possibly toward AWACS at [4,0] or SAM at [3,6].  \n- Continuing leftward movement aligns with the pattern, potentially uncovering unseen areas, especially if enemies are to the right.  \n\n## Evaluating unit safety  \n- AWACS at [4,0] with radar radius 9 and SAM at [3,6] with radar 8 likely cover much of a small grid, reducing immediate threats.  \n- No enemies detected, so AWACS can WAIT or move laterally/backward for safety, while aircraft explore.  \n\n## Planning next actions  \n- Aircraft, armed with radar=5, should move to explore, possibly continuing left to align with past behavior.  \n- The tool \"select_actions\" must be used to choose moves, ensuring at least one unit advances exploration per turn.\n\n## Continuing movement analysis  \n- Aircraft#2 and #3 have historically moved LEFT (decreasing X), from [9,3] to [7,3] and [9,9] to [7,9], likely for exploration.  \n- Given the pattern, continuing LEFT aligns with past behavior, potentially uncovering TEAM-UNSEEN cells to the left.  \n\n## Evaluating action options  \n- Actions include MOVE, WAIT, SHOOT, or TOGGLE_RADAR; SHOOT is irrelevant without enemies, and TOGGLE_RADAR assumes radar is on by default.  \n- MOVE LEFT for aircraft and WAIT for AWACS are viable, with reason_tags like EXPLORE_UNSEEN for exploration moves.  \n\n## Assessing grid and safety  \n- Grid size is unclear, but positions suggest 10x10 or larger, with AWACS radar=9 covering up to x=13, y=9, likely safe.  \n- No enemies detected, so aircraft can move forward (LEFT) to extend coverage, while AWACS stays put for protection.  \n\n## Planning exploration strategy  \n- P4 (gain information) requires at least one unit to advance exploration each turn, favoring aircraft moving LEFT.  \n- Spreading aircraft UP or DOWN could cover more area, but continuing LEFT maintains consistency and aligns with past scouting.\n\n## Reviewing exploration validity  \n- Moving aircraft left keeps them within AWACS radar range (radius 9), covering positions like [6,3] and [6,9].  \n- H4 rule states exploration inside friendly radar has zero value, making EXPLORE_UNSEEN invalid for these moves.  \n\n## Assessing reason tags  \n- REPOSITION_FOR_EXPLORATION is valid since no map confirms TEAM-UNSEEN cells, aligning with past movement patterns.  \n- EXPLORE_UNSEEN requires targets outside friendly radar, which isn’t met, so use REPOSITION_FOR_EXPLORATION instead.  \n\n## Planning unit actions  \n- Aircraft#2 and #3 should MOVE LEFT with reason_tag REPOSITION_FOR_EXPLORATION, continuing the pattern.  \n- AWACS and SAM can WAIT or be omitted, as no threats or targets justify action, and SAM radar is likely on by default.\n\n## Evaluating exploration constraints  \n- AWACS radar (radius 9) and SAM radar (radius 8 at [3,6]) likely cover most of the grid, making TEAM-UNSEEN cells hard to reach without moving units.  \n- Without a map, it's unclear if TEAM-UNSEEN cells exist, potentially deactivating P4 (gain information) and halting exploration moves.  \n\n## Considering repositioning strategy  \n- Moving aircraft to the edge of coverage aligns with REPOSITION_FOR_EXPLORATION, preparing for future exploration without violating H4.  \n- Historical leftward movement suggests the boundary lies left, and continuing this pattern fits the goal of extending known space.  \n\n## Assessing unit roles  \n- Aircraft#2 and #3 should MOVE LEFT to reposition, maintaining consistency with past turns and supporting P4 if active.  \n- AWACS stays stationary (WAIT or omit) due to S2 preference for lateral/backward movement, avoiding risky advances.\n\n## Confirming unit actions  \n- Aircraft#2 and #3 should MOVE LEFT with reason_tag REPOSITION_FOR_EXPLORATION, following the consistent pattern.  \n- SAM and AWACS can WAIT or be omitted, as no actions like TOGGLE_RADAR are needed, assuming radar is on by default.  \n\n## Validating reason tags  \n- The tool schema lists reason_tag options like HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDENCE, but human instructions mention PROTECT_AWACS and others.  \n- Must use the tool’s enum (e.g., LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE) as it overrides additional instructions, ensuring compliance.",
