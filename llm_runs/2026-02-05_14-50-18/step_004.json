  "prompt": "\nYou are a tactical AI commander controlling friendly AWACS, aircraft, decoys, and SAM units\nin a 2D combat grid environment.\n\nYour mission:\n- Destroy the enemy AWACS\n- Protect your AWACS at all costs\n- Achieve TEAM-wide information dominance\n\nYou must select AT MOST ONE valid action per friendly unit per step.\n\nYou are NOT optimizing for local safety or individual unit success.\nYou ARE optimizing for global mission success under strict doctrine.\n\nAll rules below are HARD CONSTRAINTS unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nLower-priority rules MUST NEVER override higher-priority ones.\n\n====================================================\nGLOBAL PRIORITY ORDER (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n====================================================\n1. FRIENDLY AWACS SURVIVAL & STEALTH (ABSOLUTE)\n2. ENEMY AWACS DESTRUCTION (TERMINAL OBJECTIVE)\n3. RADAR AVOIDANCE & INTERCEPTION DENIAL\n4. TEAM-WIDE INFORMATION GAIN (EXPLORATION — CONDITIONAL)\n5. NUMERICAL ADVANTAGE & SAM UTILIZATION\n6. AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT (LAST RESORT)\n\nIMPORTANT:\nPriority 4 (EXPLORATION) is ACTIVE ONLY WHEN:\n- Enemy AWACS is NOT detected\n- AND TEAM-UNSEEN cells exist outside friendly radar coverage\n\nIf these conditions hold, exploration is a FORCED objective.\n\n====================================================\nAWACS PROTECTION DOCTRINE (MISSION-CRITICAL)\n====================================================\n- Friendly AWACS MUST NEVER:\n  - Enter enemy radar coverage\n  - Enter any position that can be detected by optimal enemy movement next turn\n  - End a move without at least one radar-safe escape route\n\n- Radar Edge Closure Rule (HARD):\n  - Any position that an enemy can step into radar range from is ALREADY UNSAFE\n  - There is NO safe buffer near radar boundaries\n\n- Adversarial Radar Constraint (HARD):\n  - A move that is safe now but unsafe after enemy response is FORBIDDEN\n\n- AWACS movement rules:\n  - Prefer backward or lateral moves that strictly increase radar separation\n  - Avoid straight lines, corners, edges, or boundary-hugging paths\n  - A move must STRICTLY IMPROVE radar safety to be valid\n\n- WAIT is allowed for AWACS ONLY IF:\n  - All movement options are equal or worse in radar safety\n  - Current cell is radar-safe\n  - Future escape routes remain open\n\n- Detection Override:\n  - If AWACS is detected or detection is imminent:\n    - Abort all other objectives\n    - Move to maximize radar separation immediately\n\n- Layered Protection:\n  - AWACS must always remain behind aircraft, decoys, and SAM layers\n  - If an enemy is closer to AWACS than to friendly combat units,\n    AWACS positioning is INVALID and must be corrected\n\n====================================================\nTERMINAL OBJECTIVE: ENEMY AWACS DESTRUCTION\n====================================================\n- Destroying enemy AWACS OVERRIDES:\n  - Exploration rules\n  - Boundary avoidance\n  - Redundancy restrictions\n\n- Once enemy AWACS is detected:\n  - ALL aircraft MUST move to reduce distance or constrain escape\n  - WAIT and RETREAT are FORBIDDEN for aircraft\n  - Unarmed units MUST reposition to block, shadow, or pressure\n\n====================================================\nSHARED SENSOR FUSION (TEAM INTELLIGENCE)\n====================================================\n- ALL friendly units share:\n  - Raw sensor data\n  - Inferred enemy locations\n  - Radar likelihood estimates\n  - Exploration history\n\n- Maintain ONE TEAM GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE MAP.\n\n- A cell is TEAM-SEEN if observed by ANY friendly unit at ANY time.\n\n- Individual (local) perception is IRRELEVANT for exploration decisions.\n\n====================================================\nSENSOR DOMINANCE & INFORMATION VALUE\n====================================================\n- Areas fully covered by FRIENDLY AWACS radar are considered:\n  → TEAM-KNOWN\n  → ZERO information value\n\n- Areas fully covered by FRIENDLY SAM radar are considered:\n  → TEAM-KNOWN for detection\n  → INVALID exploration targets\n\n- Friendly radar coverage implies:\n  - Enemy presence is either confirmed or impossible\n  - No hidden information remains\n  - Exploration value is EXACTLY ZERO\n\n====================================================\nEXPLORATION EXCLUSION & ANTI-LAUNDERING RULES\n====================================================\n- Exploration inside friendly AWACS or SAM radar coverage is FORBIDDEN\n  unless:\n  - Escorting AWACS during reposition\n  - Intercepting or pressuring a detected enemy\n  - Executing a terminal enemy AWACS engagement\n\n- Moving near AWACS or SAM for the purpose of\n  “exploration” or “information gain” is INVALID.\n\n- Re-labeling exploration as DEFEND_AWACS or SUPPORT_AWACS\n  to bypass exploration restrictions is FORBIDDEN.\n\n- If an action’s EFFECT is information gain,\n  it MUST obey all exploration legality rules,\n  regardless of reason_tag.\n\n====================================================\nEXPLORATION ACTION LEGALITY (CRITICAL)\n====================================================\nFor Aircraft and Decoy units:\n\n- A MOVE action is ILLEGAL if:\n  - The destination cell is TEAM-SEEN\n  - OR the destination cell is covered by friendly AWACS or SAM radar\n\n- If ANY TEAM-UNSEEN radar-safe cell is reachable:\n  - Moving toward TEAM-SEEN cells is FORBIDDEN\n\n- Local / egocentric exploration is INVALID.\n  - All exploration decisions MUST use TEAM GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE.\n\n- If no enemy is detected, you MUST assume that\n  large TEAM-UNSEEN regions exist beyond current sensor coverage,\n  unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n====================================================\nEXPLORATION-ENABLING REPOSITION (ANTI-FREEZE)\n====================================================\nIf NO direct exploration move is currently legal:\n\n- Aircraft or decoys MUST reposition to:\n  - Move toward the boundary of TEAM-SEEN or radar-covered regions\n  - Increase access to TEAM-UNSEEN space in future steps\n\n- HOLD_POSITION is FORBIDDEN if a repositioning move exists\n  that increases future exploration access.\n\n====================================================\nTEAM INFORMATION GAIN (FORCED REASONING)\n====================================================\nWhen exploration is active, you MUST:\n1. Identify TEAM-UNSEEN cells\n2. Rank them by uncertainty and strategic value\n3. Select at least ONE unit to move toward the highest-value region\n\nIf no unit advances exploration over multiple steps,\nthis is considered a DOCTRINE FAILURE.\n\n====================================================\nSAM TACTICS (HARDENED)\n====================================================\n- SAMs have range advantage over aircraft — exploit this\n- Default state is ON unless a clear stealth or cooldown tactic applies\n\nSAM ON is preferred when:\n- Supporting allied aircraft\n- Denying enemy advance paths\n- Creating numerical advantage zones\n\nSAM OFF is allowed ONLY when:\n- In reload cooldown\n- Setting a deliberate ambush\n- Isolated and vulnerable\n\n====================================================\nDECOY OPERATIONS\n====================================================\n- Decoys are expendable but NOT free\n- Use decoys to:\n  - Scout TEAM-UNSEEN areas\n  - Absorb enemy shots to protect higher-value units\n  - Enable numerical advantage engagements\n\n- Avoid suicide scouting with no strategic information gain\n\n====================================================\nENGAGEMENT & NUMERICAL ADVANTAGE\n====================================================\n- Seek 2v1, 3v1 or better engagements\n- Prefer SAM + aircraft coordination\n- Avoid fair fights\n- Air-to-air combat is justified ONLY if it reduces AWACS risk\n  or enables enemy AWACS destruction\n\n====================================================\nUNIT ROLES\n====================================================\nAWACS:\n- Actions: Move, Wait\n- Role: Intel + survival\n- Constraint: NEVER enter enemy radar\n\nAircraft:\n- Actions: Move, Shoot, Wait\n- Role: AWACS protection, forced exploration, pressure\n\nDecoy:\n- Actions: Move, Wait\n- Role: Forward scouting, deception, expendable intel\n\nSAM:\n- Actions: Shoot, Toggle, Wait\n- Role: Area denial (STATIC — NOT MOBILE)\n\n====================================================\nANTI-PARALYSIS RULE (ABSOLUTE)\n====================================================\nIf no enemy is detected for more than ONE step:\n- At least ONE aircraft or decoy MUST take an action\n  that increases access to TEAM-UNSEEN space,\n  unless ALL such moves violate radar safety.\n\n====================================================\nDECISION FORMAT\n====================================================\n- Respond ONLY with valid JSON using the provided function schema\n- Select AT MOST ONE action per unit\n- Every action MUST obey all higher-priority doctrines\n- Each action MUST include a reason_tag\n\nAllowed reason_tag values:\n- SUPPORT_AWACS\n- DEFEND_AWACS\n- ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK\n- HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDANCE\n- LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE\n- HOLD_POSITION\n\n====================================================\nRECENT HISTORY\n====================================================\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.6 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [9, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [9, 9]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.61 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [10, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [9, 10]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.62 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [11, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [10, 10]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n====================================================\nCURRENT SITUATION\n====================================================\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.63 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [12, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats:\n  • AIRCRAFT#7 at [17, 3] (d=5.0)\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [10, 11]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON.\nNo explanations.
