  "prompt": "\nYou are a tactical AI controlling aircraft and ground units.\n\n ### ADVANCED TACTICAL DOCTRINES (STRICT & MANDATORY)\n\n    GLOBAL PRIORITY ORDER (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n    1. AWACS SURVIVAL & STEALTH (mission-critical)\n    2. Enemy AWACS Destruction\n    3. Radar Avoidance\n    4. Efficient Exploration & Coverage\n    5. SAM Utilization\n    6. Air-to-Air Combat (LAST RESORT)\n\n    AWACS STEALTH & SURVIVAL DOCTRINE (CRITICAL):\n    - Friendly AWACS MUST NEVER ENTER enemy radar range.\n    - Radar entry is mission-failure-level risk.\n    - AWACS behavior must remain PROACTIVE, not reactive.\n    - If current or next move risks enemy radar detection, MOVE AWAY IMMEDIATELY.\n    - WAIT is allowed for AWACS ONLY IF fully radar-safe, no predicted radar intersection exists, and future escape paths are preserved.\n    - Avoid straight-line or boundary-hugging movement.\n    - Prefer diagonal/offset positions to maintain maneuver space.\n\n    TERMINAL OBJECTIVE RULE:\n    - Destroying enemy AWACS is PRIMARY and OVERRIDING objective.\n    - Once enemy AWACS is detected, ALL aircraft must prioritize closing distance; WAIT or RETREAT is FORBIDDEN.\n    - Unarmed aircraft should still move to constrain enemy movement or support AWACS objectives.\n\n    SHARED SENSOR FUSION (TEAM INTELLIGENCE):\n    - All friendly units share raw sensor data, inferred intel, and explored-area maps.\n    - Maintain a TEAM GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE MAP updated every step.\n    - Areas seen by ANY friendly unit (past or present) are considered TEAM-SEEN.\n    - Exploration decisions MUST use the TEAM map, not local observations.\n    - Redundant exploration of TEAM-SEEN areas is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN unless escorting, defending, or re-validating stale intel.\n\n    TEAM INFORMATION GAIN OBJECTIVE:\n    - Primary objective is maximizing TEAM information gain per action.\n    - Actively reason about what the TEAM does NOT know.\n    - Prefer actions that expand overall team situational awareness, not individual coverage.\n\n    BOUNDARY AWARENESS:\n    - Do not overextend toward map edges.\n    - Preserve future maneuver space.\n    - Edge exploration is allowed only if the area is TEAM-UNSEEN and high value.\n\n    ### UNIT ROLES\n    **AWACS**: Move, Wait. Mission-critical: survive & provide intel. Never enter enemy radar.\n    **Aircraft**: Move, Shoot, Wait. Protect AWACS. Primary scouts.\n    **Decoy**: Move, Wait. Appear as aircraft to distract enemy.\n    **SAM**: Shoot, Toggle, Wait. Area denial. Only detected aircraft may retreat near SAM.\n\n    ### SCOUTING & MOVEMENT (Aircraft, TEAM-AWARE)\n    - Every move is a scouting opportunity for the TEAM.\n    - Maximize coverage of strategically valuable areas using the TEAM map.\n    - Prioritize candidate cells according to:\n    1. Unseen by ANY friendly unit (highest priority)\n    2. High probability of enemy presence (last known positions, movement paths, high-value locations)\n    3. Coverage complementarity (avoid areas teammates are already moving toward)\n    4. Safety (avoid enemy radar unless mission-critical)\n    - Avoid redundant scouting paths and mirrored movements.\n    - Prefer divergent movement patterns across friendly aircraft.\n    - Avoid repeating movement loops (e.g., UP → RIGHT → DOWN → LEFT).\n    - Lateral moves are allowed if they increase TEAM coverage or reduce risk.\n    - Wait only if no TEAM-UNSEEN or high-value area is safely reachable.\n\n\n    ### SCOUTING PRIORITY SCORING\n    - Assign a scouting priority score to each candidate cell:\n    - +3: high-probability enemy locations\n    - +2: nearby unseen cells\n    - +1: moderately risky cells that extend coverage\n    - Prefer moves that maximize total priority coverage while maintaining escape paths\n\n    ### ENEMY & ALLY CONTEXT\n    - For each friendly unit, include:\n    - Nearby enemies: id, kind, position, distance, fire_behavior, grouped, priority_score\n    - Nearby allies: id, kind, position, distance, coverage overlap\n    - Top-priority cells: list of coordinates with highest scouting priority\n    - Enemy likelihood map: cells where enemy is likely to appear next turn\n    - Safe cells: cells safe from radar / high-threat detection\n\n    ### ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n    - Avoid unnecessary air-to-air combat\n    - Prefer SAMs for pressure and attrition\n    - Only shoot if it meaningfully reduces AWACS risk\n    - Multiple units can target the same high-value enemy across turns if needed\n\n    ### DECISION FORMAT\n    - Respond ONLY with valid JSON\n    - Select at most ONE action per unit from allowed actions\n    - Include a reason_tag reflecting strategy:\n    - SUPPORT_AWACS\n    - DEFEND_AWACS\n    - ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK\n    - HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDANCE\n    - LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE\n\n    ### EXAMPLE REASON_TAGS\n    - HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDANCE\n    - LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE\n    - ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK\n    - SUPPORT_AWACS\n    - DEFEND_AWACS\n    - HOLD_POSITION\n\n    ### FRIENDLY UNITS\n    - For each unit, list position, capabilities, nearby enemies, nearby allies, allowed actions\n    - Include calculated metrics: enemy priority_score, coverage overlap, radar safety assessment, top-priority cells, enemy likelihood map\n    - Ensure moves maximize unseen/high-value area coverage while maintaining safety and avoiding redundant scanning\n\n\nFor each entity, choose AT MOST ONE action.\n\n=== Recent History ===\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.68 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [5, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [7, 2]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [3, 9]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.69 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [5, 4]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [7, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [3, 8]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.7 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [5, 5]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [8, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [2, 8]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.71 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [6, 5]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [8, 4]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [2, 7]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.72 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [6, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [9, 4]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [2, 8]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n=== Current Situation ===\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.73 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [7, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [9, 5]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats:\n  • AIRCRAFT#7 at [13, 3] (d=4.5)\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [1, 8]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON using the provided function schema.\n",

The function is \"select_actions\" with parameters for actions array, each having entity_id, action, dir (if applicable), reason_tag, and optional note.\n\n\n## Examining System Prompt  \n- The system identifies me as an action-selection module with specific response requirements.  \n- Responses must use the \"select_actions\" function, including parameters like entity_id, action, dir (if applicable), reason_tag, and an optional note.\n\n## Reviewing Entity Details  \n- Four entities identified: AWACS#1 (likely ID 1), AIRCRAFT#2 (ID 2), AIRCRAFT#3 (ID 3), and SAM#4 (ID 4).  \n- Each entity requires at most one action selection based on their current positions and movement history.  \n\n## Analyzing Movement Patterns  \n- AWACS#1 at [7,6] shows right-up-ish movement historically, possibly correcting earlier downward trends.  \n- AIRCRAFT#2 at [9,5] moves right-up, faces a nearby threat (AIRCRAFT#7 at [13,3], distance 4.5).  \n- AIRCRAFT#3 at [1,8] moves left-up then slightly down; SAM#4 at [3,6] remains static.  \n\n## Assessing Threat Environment  \n- Only one enemy detected: AIRCRAFT#7 near AIRCRAFT#2, no enemy radars mentioned.  \n- AWACS survival is top priority, with no immediate threats to AWACS#1 currently.  \n\n## Evaluating Strategic Priorities  \n- Doctrines emphasize AWACS survival and radar avoidance, with no enemy AWACS detected.  \n- Aggression level at 0.73 and rising suggests a safer strategy of pressuring rather than retreating.\n\n## Evaluating Action Options  \n- Action tags include HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDENCE, LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE, ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK, and SCOUTING_BEHAVIOR, guiding entity decisions.  \n- AWACS#1, with no nearby threats, may prioritize LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE or SCOUTING_BEHAVIOR for proactive exploration.  \n\n## Assessing AWACS Movement  \n- AWACS#1's recent moves (RIGHT then DOWN) suggest a diagonal SE pattern; next move could be DOWN to [7,7] or LEFT for exploration.  \n- Doctrines advise against straight-line paths; moving diagonally (e.g., UP or LEFT) helps maintain stealth and coverage.  \n\n## Analyzing AIRCRAFT#2 Strategy  \n- AIRCRAFT#2, facing enemy AIRCRAFT#7 at distance 4.5, may consider LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE or ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK given high aggression (0.73).  \n- Shooting is plausible if range (e.g., 5) allows, but without confirmed shoot range, advancing towards the enemy aligns with scouting priorities.  \n\n## Reviewing AIRCRAFT#3 and SAM#4 Roles  \n- AIRCRAFT#3 shows leftward, possibly oscillating movement, suggesting top-left scouting; diverging paths could avoid redundancy.  \n- SAM#4, static at [3,6] and far from threats, likely holds position (HOLD_POSITION) to maintain defensive readiness.  \n\n## Prioritizing Exploration and Threats  \n- Lower-right quadrant, where AIRCRAFT#7 was detected, is a high-priority scouting area due to potential enemy presence.  \n- Exploration focuses on unseen areas, balancing team info gain with avoiding unnecessary combat, per doctrines.\n\n## Refining AWACS Strategy  \n- AWACS#1 at [7,6] is currently safe from enemy AIRCRAFT#7 at [13,3], with a distance of 6.7, assuming enemy radar range is 5.  \n- Possible moves like RIGHT to [8,6] (distance ~5.8) or DOWN to [7,7] (~7.2) are evaluated; AWACS must stay beyond enemy radar range, likely prioritizing LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE or SCOUTING_BEHAVIOR.  \n\n## Ensuring Safety Margins  \n- Doctrines stress avoiding enemy radar detection; AWACS should choose moves maintaining distance >5 from known enemies, with UP or LEFT potentially safer than RIGHT.  \n- Future paths must avoid detection risk, especially with enemy aircraft movement possible; a margin beyond radar range (e.g., >5.8) is advised for safety.  \n\n## Directing AIRCRAFT#2 Actions  \n- AIRCRAFT#2, closest to enemy AIRCRAFT#7 at distance 4.5, may opt for \"Shoot\" under ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK, given high aggression (0.73) and potential threat to AWACS.  \n- Shooting is air-to-air capable and aligns with pressuring the enemy, reducing risk, though shoot range specifics remain unclear.  \n\n## Guiding AIRCRAFT#3 Exploration  \n- AIRCRAFT#3 at [1,8], far left and threat-free, should scout unexplored areas like DOWN to cover left bottom or RIGHT to center, avoiding redundancy.  \n- Boundary awareness is key; near edge (x=1), overextension to edges like LEFT to 0 is risky, so RIGHT DOWN may balance exploration and safety.\n\n## Adjusting AWACS Movement  \n- AWACS#1 at [7,6] faces potential radar intersection if enemy moves closer; current distance to enemy at [13,3] is 6.7, safe if radar range is 5.  \n- Moving RIGHT to [8,6] risks detection (distance ~5) if enemy moves LEFT or DOWN; safer options are LEFT to [6,6] or UP to [7,5], maintaining distance >5.  \n\n## Optimizing AIRCRAFT#2 Engagement  \n- AIRCRAFT#2, at distance 4.5 from enemy, should shoot under ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK, aligning with high aggression and nearby threat reduction.  \n- Shooting is air-to-air capable and assumed within range, pressuring enemy to protect AWACS and team assets.",
