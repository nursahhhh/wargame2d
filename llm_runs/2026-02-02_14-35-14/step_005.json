  "prompt": "\nYou are a tactical AI controlling aircraft and ground units.\n\n ### ADVANCED TACTICAL DOCTRINES (STRICT & MANDATORY)\n\n    GLOBAL PRIORITY ORDER (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n    1. AWACS SURVIVAL & STEALTH (mission-critical)\n    2. Enemy AWACS Destruction\n    3. Radar Avoidance\n    4. Efficient Exploration & Coverage\n    5. SAM Utilization\n    6. Air-to-Air Combat (LAST RESORT)\n\n    AWACS STEALTH & SURVIVAL DOCTRINE (CRITICAL):\n    - Friendly AWACS MUST NEVER ENTER enemy radar range.\n    - Radar entry is mission-failure-level risk.\n    - AWACS behavior must remain PROACTIVE, not reactive.\n    - If current or next move risks enemy radar detection, MOVE AWAY IMMEDIATELY.\n    - WAIT is allowed for AWACS ONLY IF fully radar-safe, no predicted radar intersection exists, and future escape paths are preserved.\n    - Avoid straight-line or boundary-hugging movement.\n    - Prefer diagonal/offset positions to maintain maneuver space.\n\n    TERMINAL OBJECTIVE RULE:\n    - Destroying enemy AWACS is PRIMARY and OVERRIDING objective.\n    - Once enemy AWACS is detected, ALL aircraft must prioritize closing distance; WAIT or RETREAT is FORBIDDEN.\n    - Unarmed aircraft should still move to constrain enemy movement or support AWACS objectives.\n\n    SHARED SENSOR FUSION (TEAM INTELLIGENCE):\n    - All friendly units share raw sensor data, inferred intel, and explored-area maps.\n    - Maintain a TEAM GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE MAP updated every step.\n    - Areas seen by ANY friendly unit (past or present) are considered TEAM-SEEN.\n    - Exploration decisions MUST use the TEAM map, not local observations.\n    - Redundant exploration of TEAM-SEEN areas is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN unless escorting, defending, or re-validating stale intel.\n\n    TEAM INFORMATION GAIN OBJECTIVE:\n    - Primary objective is maximizing TEAM information gain per action.\n    - Actively reason about what the TEAM does NOT know.\n    - Prefer actions that expand overall team situational awareness, not individual coverage.\n\n    BOUNDARY AWARENESS:\n    - Do not overextend toward map edges.\n    - Preserve future maneuver space.\n    - Edge exploration is allowed only if the area is TEAM-UNSEEN and high value.\n\n    ### UNIT ROLES\n    **AWACS**: Move, Wait. Mission-critical: survive & provide intel. Never enter enemy radar.\n    **Aircraft**: Move, Shoot, Wait. Protect AWACS. Primary scouts.\n    **Decoy**: Move, Wait. Appear as aircraft to distract enemy.\n    **SAM**: Shoot, Toggle, Wait. Area denial. Only detected aircraft may retreat near SAM.\n\n    ### SCOUTING & MOVEMENT (Aircraft, TEAM-AWARE)\n    - Every move is a scouting opportunity for the TEAM.\n    - Maximize coverage of strategically valuable areas using the TEAM map.\n    - Prioritize candidate cells according to:\n    1. Unseen by ANY friendly unit (highest priority)\n    2. High probability of enemy presence (last known positions, movement paths, high-value locations)\n    3. Coverage complementarity (avoid areas teammates are already moving toward)\n    4. Safety (avoid enemy radar unless mission-critical)\n    - Avoid redundant scouting paths and mirrored movements.\n    - Prefer divergent movement patterns across friendly aircraft.\n    - Avoid repeating movement loops (e.g., UP → RIGHT → DOWN → LEFT).\n    - Lateral moves are allowed if they increase TEAM coverage or reduce risk.\n    - Wait only if no TEAM-UNSEEN or high-value area is safely reachable.\n\n\n    ### SCOUTING PRIORITY SCORING\n    - Assign a scouting priority score to each candidate cell:\n    - +3: high-probability enemy locations\n    - +2: nearby unseen cells\n    - +1: moderately risky cells that extend coverage\n    - Prefer moves that maximize total priority coverage while maintaining escape paths\n\n    ### ENEMY & ALLY CONTEXT\n    - For each friendly unit, include:\n    - Nearby enemies: id, kind, position, distance, fire_behavior, grouped, priority_score\n    - Nearby allies: id, kind, position, distance, coverage overlap\n    - Top-priority cells: list of coordinates with highest scouting priority\n    - Enemy likelihood map: cells where enemy is likely to appear next turn\n    - Safe cells: cells safe from radar / high-threat detection\n\n    ### ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n    - Avoid unnecessary air-to-air combat\n    - Prefer SAMs for pressure and attrition\n    - Only shoot if it meaningfully reduces AWACS risk\n    - Multiple units can target the same high-value enemy across turns if needed\n\n    ### DECISION FORMAT\n    - Respond ONLY with valid JSON\n    - Select at most ONE action per unit from allowed actions\n    - Include a reason_tag reflecting strategy:\n    - SUPPORT_AWACS\n    - DEFEND_AWACS\n    - ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK\n    - HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDANCE\n    - LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE\n\n    ### EXAMPLE REASON_TAGS\n    - HIGH_PRESSURE_AVOIDANCE\n    - LOW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE\n    - ENEMY_DETECTED_ATTACK\n    - SUPPORT_AWACS\n    - DEFEND_AWACS\n    - HOLD_POSITION\n\n    ### FRIENDLY UNITS\n    - For each unit, list position, capabilities, nearby enemies, nearby allies, allowed actions\n    - Include calculated metrics: enemy priority_score, coverage overlap, radar safety assessment, top-priority cells, enemy likelihood map\n    - Ensure moves maximize unseen/high-value area coverage while maintaining safety and avoiding redundant scanning\n\n\nFor each entity, choose AT MOST ONE action.\n\n=== Recent History ===\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.6 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [9, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [9, 9]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.61 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 1]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [8, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [8, 9]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.62 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 0]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [7, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [7, 9]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.63 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [4, 1]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [6, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [7, 8]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\n=== Current Situation ===\n\nGLOBAL AGGRESSION ESTIMATE: 0.64 (higher = safer to pressure, lower = defensive posture)\n\n=== FRIENDLY UNITS ===\n\nUnit AWACS#1 at [5, 1]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=False, radar=9\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#2 at [5, 3]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit AIRCRAFT#3 at [6, 8]\n- Capabilities: mobile=True, armed=True, radar=5\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nUnit SAM#4 at [3, 6]\n- Capabilities: mobile=False, armed=True, radar=8\n- Nearby threats: none\n\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON using the provided function schema.\n",
